Hello {{ fullname }}!

Thank you for signing up via a paper form to join a neighborhood forum with E-Democracy.Org.

In short, our Issues Forums are public online two-way exchanges about issues and life in YOUR community.   We use real names and promise to be civil without name-calling (unlike and different than most other places online.)

In the next 48 hours, your name and e-mail will be registered with our http://forums.e-democracy.org site.  Please visit our site to understand our forums.  In addition, you should review our rules and privacy and public life policy for participation (http://e-democracy.org/rules).

If you DO NOT wish for any reason to join this forum, to ask a question, or to use a different e-mail address; please inform us by replying to this message.  Otherwise, please sit tight and watch for a verification request message in the coming day.   This email will have links and instructions to set your password and to fill out your public profile.

Thank you for joining your fellow community members in your local Issues Forum.
